# Explanation of `config/gemini.js`

This file is responsible for **setting up and managing the connection to the Gemini API**. Let’s break it down:

1. **Importing the SDK**  
   ```js
   const { GoogleGenAI } = require('@google/genai')
   ```  
   This brings in the official Gemini SDK so we can interact with the model.

2. **Initializing the Client**  
   ```js
   const genAI = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY })
   ```  
   - The API key is pulled from an environment variable (`process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY`).  
   - This is a best practice: never hard‑code secrets in your codebase.  

3. **Choosing the Model**  
   ```js
   const MODEL_NAME = "models/gemini-2.0-flash";
   ```  
   - Gemini offers multiple models (flash, pro, lite, etc.).  
   - Here we lock in one model for consistency.  

4. **Defining the `model` Function**  
   ```js
   const model = async (prompt) => { ... }
   ```  
   - This function takes a `prompt` string and sends it to Gemini.  
   - It wraps the SDK call in a `try/catch` block for error handling.  

5. **Building the Request**  
   ```js
   const contents = [{ role: "user", parts: [{ text: prompt }] }];
   ```  
   - Gemini expects input in a structured format: roles (`user`, `assistant`) and parts (text, images, etc.).  
   - Here we’re sending a simple text prompt.  

6. **Making the API Call**  
   ```js
   const response = await genAI.models.generateContent({
     model: MODEL_NAME,
     contents,
     config: { temperature: 0.1 },
   });
   ```  
   - `temperature: 0.1` means the output will be more deterministic and less “creative.”  
   - This is good for structured JSON responses.  

7. **Debug Logging (Optional)**
   ```js
   if (process.env.DEBUG_GEMINI === "true") {
     console.log("Gemini Response:", response);
   }
   ```
   - When `DEBUG_GEMINI=true`, this logs the full response for debugging.
   - Helpful for students to see the raw AI output before processing.

## 🚫 Common Error Scenarios

### 1. **Invalid API Key**
```js
// Error: 400 API_KEY_INVALID
```
**Solution:** Verify your API key in Google AI Studio and update `.env`

### 2. **Rate Limit Exceeded** 
```js
// Error: 429 RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED
```
**Solution:** Implement retry logic with exponential backoff or upgrade quota

### 3. **Model Unavailable**
```js
// Error: 503 SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE  
```
**Solution:** Switch to alternative model or implement fallback response

### 4. **Network Issues**
```js
// Error: ENOTFOUND or timeout
```
**Solution:** Check internet connection, implement retry mechanism

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Tips

### Debug Mode Setup
1. Set `DEBUG_GEMINI=true` in your `.env`
2. Check console output for full API responses
3. Verify prompt structure and model parameters

### Performance Optimization
- Use lower temperature (0.1) for consistent JSON output
- Consider caching responses for identical prompts
- Monitor API usage in Google Cloud Console  
   ```js
   if (process.env.DEBUG_GEMINI === "true") {
     console.log("🔍 FULL Gemini SDK response object:", JSON.stringify(response, null, 2));
     if (response?.text) {
       console.log("✅ Gemini .text property:", response.text);
     } else {
       console.warn("⚠ No .text property found on Gemini response");
     }
   }
   ```  
   - Debug logs are only shown if `DEBUG_GEMINI` is set to `"true"`.  
   - This prevents cluttering production logs while still allowing detailed inspection during development.  

8. **Returning the Response**  
   ```js
   return response;
   ```  
   - The full response object is returned so that services (like `fitnessService.js`) can access `response.text`.

### Why This Code Lives in `config/`

- **Configuration Responsibility**:  
  This file is about **setting up the Gemini client** — API key, model choice, and connection details. That’s why it belongs in `config/`.  

- **Separation of Concerns**:  
  - `config/` → handles setup and environment‑specific details.  
  - `services/` → handles business logic (e.g., building prompts, interpreting responses).  

This separation makes the project easier to maintain and easier for students to understand: *“config is setup, services is logic.”*  

---

### Could It Be in `services/`?

Yes, it could. If you wanted to keep things simpler for a very small project, you could place this file in `services/` and treat it as just another service.  

- **Pro (services/):** Fewer folders, simpler navigation for beginners.  
- **Pro (config/):** Clearer architecture, easier to scale when you add more external services (databases, APIs, etc.).  

For teaching, keeping it in `config/` is a good choice because it reinforces the idea of **separating setup from logic**.

### Suggested Improvements

1. **Helper for Debug Logging**  
   Extract the debug logging into a small helper function. This keeps the main function cleaner:  
   ```js
   function debugLog(response) {
     console.log("🔍 FULL Gemini SDK response object:", JSON.stringify(response, null, 2));
     if (response?.text) {
       console.log("✅ Gemini .text property:", response.text);
     } else {
       console.warn("⚠ No .text property found on Gemini response");
     }
   }
   ```
   Then call it only if `DEBUG_GEMINI` is true.  

2. **Configurable Model Name**  
   Instead of hard‑coding `models/gemini-2.0-flash`, you could read it from an environment variable (`process.env.GEMINI_MODEL`). This makes it easier to switch models without editing code.  

3. **Centralized Error Handling**  
   Right now, errors are logged and re‑thrown. You could standardize error messages or wrap them in a custom error type to make debugging easier.  

4. **Return Only What’s Needed**  
   If your services only ever use `response.text`, you could return just that instead of the full object. This reduces coupling to the SDK’s internal structure.
